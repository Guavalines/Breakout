# BREAKOUT

Check it out here: [Breakout](https://guavalines.github.io/Breakout/)

This is a basic implementation of Breakout in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with game logic handling various elements of the game such as blocks, user, ball, and score display. The game blocks are created using a Block class and added to the grid using a for loop and the addBlocks function. The user's position is updated using the moveUser function and the ball's position is updated using the moveBall function which also detects collisions using the checkForCollisions function. The score is updated using the scoreDisplay variable and the scoreDisplay.innerHTML property. This code provides a starting point for building a more complex version of Breakout.
